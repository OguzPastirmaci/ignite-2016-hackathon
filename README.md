# How are we going to be evaluated? #

Your team will be evaluated based on the DevOps practices implemented in your project, NOT based on your application itself. Implementing "Infrastructure as Code" and "Continuous Integration" practices is mandatory. Every other DevOps practice implementation will earn your team bonus points.
